# dbt_amazon_ads v0.4.0
[PR #16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/pull/16) includes the following updates:

## Feature Update: Conversions Support
- We have added conversion metrics to each of the end models by default.
- The conversion metrics are the following:
  - `purchases_30_d`: Number of attributed conversion events occurring within 30 days of an ad click.
  - `sales_30_d`: Total value of sales occurring within 30 days of an ad click.
- To bring in other conversion fields (`purchases_same_sku_30_d`, `sales_14_d`, etc.), please refer to our [passthrough column variables](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads_source?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics).

> The above new field additions are **breaking changes** for users who were not already bringing in conversion fields via passthrough columns.

## Under the Hood
- Created `amazon_ads_persist_pass_through_columns` macro to ensure that the new conversion fields are backwards compatible with users who have already included them via [passthrough columns](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics) . The package will dynamically avoid "duplicate column" errors.
- Added integrity and consistency validation tests within `integration_tests` folder for the transformation models (to be used by maintainers only).
- Added documentation explaining potential discrepancies across reporting grains. See the [DECISIONLOG.md](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md).

# dbt_amazon_ads v0.3.0
[PR #11](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/pull/11) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple amazon_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.

- Produces modeled tables that leverage Amazon Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Amazon Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads_source).
